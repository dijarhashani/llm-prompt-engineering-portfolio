# Review Agent Failure Modes

Common failure patterns:

1. **Generic Feedback**
   - Feedback is vague or non-actionable
2. **Overwriting Outputs**
   - Review agent rewrites output instead of critiquing
3. **Missed Hidden Assumptions**
   - Fails to detect implicit violations of constraints
4. **Inconsistent Severity**
   - Severity scores are not standardized

Mitigation strategies:
- Explicit instructions on output structure
- Examples of acceptable critique
- Standardized severity scoring
