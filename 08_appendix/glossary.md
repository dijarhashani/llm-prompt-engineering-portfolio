# Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the prompt engineering portfolio.

---

**Agent**  
A role-based LLM component that performs specific tasks (e.g., Planner, Critic, Review Agent).

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**  
A reasoning pattern where the model explains its reasoning step by step internally or externally.

**Constraint Patterns**  
Rules or schemas enforced on prompt outputs to maintain structure, safety, or format.

**Failure Mode**  
A predictable type of error or undesired behavior in prompt output.

**Memory Patterns**  
Strategies for retaining and referencing context across multi-step or multi-agent workflows.

**Prompt Injection**  
An attack where user input attempts to override system instructions.

**Red Team / Blue Team**  
Red Team: Simulates attacks on prompt systems  
Blue Team: Implements defenses and mitigations

**Role-Based Prompting**  
Assigning specific roles to the model to guide behavior and scope.

**System Prompt**  
The foundational instruction defining the model’s role, identity, and constraints.

**Evaluation Metrics**  
Quantitative measures used to assess prompt performance (e.g., accuracy, consistency, safety).

**Reproducibility**  
Ensuring experiments, prompt executions, and outputs can be reliably repeated under the same environment.
