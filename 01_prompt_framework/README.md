# Prompt Framework

This directory contains a **reusable prompt engineering framework** designed for building
**controlled, evaluatable, and production-ready LLM systems**.

The framework is organized into four core categories:

- Role-based prompting
- Reasoning patterns
- Constraint patterns
- Safety and guardrails

Each prompt pattern is designed to be:
- Composable
- Versionable
- Evaluatable
- Resistant to common failure modes

This framework is intended to be used **across domains**, not tied to a single use case.
