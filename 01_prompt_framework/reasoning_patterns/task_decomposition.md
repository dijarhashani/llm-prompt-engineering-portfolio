# Task Decomposition Pattern

Complex tasks are decomposed into smaller, verifiable units.

---

## Why It Matters
- Reduces cognitive overload
- Improves accuracy
- Enables partial retries

---

## Pattern

1. Understand the task
2. Identify constraints
3. Decompose into steps
4. Execute step-by-step
5. Validate results

---

## Common Failures
- Skipping decomposition
- Overloading single prompts
