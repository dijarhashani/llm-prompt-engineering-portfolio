# Prompt Security Lab

This directory explores **prompt security** in a controlled, senior-level environment.

Key objectives:

1. Identify **common attack patterns** against LLM prompts  
2. Document **defense patterns** to mitigate these attacks  
3. Conduct **Red Team vs Blue Team exercises** to evaluate robustness  

This lab is designed for **learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration**.
