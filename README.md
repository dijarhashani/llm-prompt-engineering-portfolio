#  LLM Prompt Engineering Portfolio

## Overview

This repository showcases my work as a **Senior Prompt Engineer**, focused on building **reliable, evaluatable, and production-ready LLM prompt systems**.

Rather than treating prompts as isolated text inputs, this portfolio approaches **prompt engineering as a software engineering discipline**, involving:

- Structured prompt design  
- Multi-step reasoning workflows  
- Agent orchestration  
- Objective evaluation  
- Failure analysis  
- Safety and security considerations  

The goal is to demonstrate how prompts **scale from experimentation to real-world AI systems**.

## Core Philosophy

> **Prompt engineering is not about “clever wording.”  
> It is about controlling model behavior under constraints.**

This portfolio is built around the following principles:

- **Reproducibility over intuition**
- **Evaluation over opinion**
- **Structure over free-form output**
- **Safety and failure awareness by default**
- **System thinking over single prompts**
