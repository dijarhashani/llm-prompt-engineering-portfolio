# Risk Analysis

- Generating overly generic recommendations
- Ignoring critical constraints (budget, regulations)
- Overconfidence in uncertain data
- Hallucinating market conditions
- Failure mitigation:
  - Explicit reasoning instructions
  - Include "unknown" option when uncertain
  - Limit output to structured JSON
